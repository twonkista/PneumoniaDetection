Created a Small CNN in PyTorch

The dataset was a modified version of the kaggle dataset by Paul Mooney: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia 

This is a freshly made baby model that is a proof of concept of a larger and more accurate model that utilizes transfer learning
